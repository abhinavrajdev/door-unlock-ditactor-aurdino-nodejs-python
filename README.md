# door-unlock-ditactor-aurdino-nodejs-python
This project utilizes aurdino to detect if a certain value of analogue signal has been passed to the reciever in aurdino pin. and sends the request to a node server to update the status. And then the node server changes itas status. And a front end which can check the value from the nodejs server continously. 

HOW T USE ??

>> First  and  <<

1. Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.
2. Install all packages using: npm i.
3. Run the python script and keep it running.
4. Start the node server and keep it running.
5. Use the front end to contact to node Server.

NOTE:- You might need to change the Arduino code to convert analogue signal to digital signal and send it throught Serial communication,
and set port carefully, ( here I am using macbook air m1 with a USB to type C convertor. ).

DONE !!!
